            "Src: Profesör 911'i Arayarak Kız Arkadaşını Öldürdüğünü İtiraf Etti 911'i arayan Üniversite Profesörü Shannon Lamb, polise kız arkadaşını silahla vurduğunu ve polisin evlerin gelmesi gerektiğini sesi yalnızca biraz titrek şekilde söyledi. Lamb, \"sevimli köpeğinin\" canlı ve muhtemelen üzgün olduğunu ve ölen kadının ailesinin telefonlarının kadının cep telefonunda bulunabileceğini belirtti. Polisler evde Amy Prentiss'in cansız bedenini ve beyaz bir not defterine el yazısıyla yazılmış bir not buldu: \"Çok üzgünüm, keşke her şeyi geri döndürebilsem, Amy'yi çok sevmiştim ve o da bugüne kadar beni seven tek kadındı\" okunan notu Lamb'in imzaladığını belirtti memurlar. Mississippi, Cleveland'deki Delta Eyalet Üniversitesi için iki çevrimiçi ders veren Lamb'in, polisin sevilen tarih profesörü Ethan Scmidt'in de Lamb tarafından ofisinin önünde vurulup öldürüldüğünü düşündüğü okul kampüsüne doğru çoktan 300 mil yol aldığına dair bir bulgu yoktu.\n",
            "Pred: Professor Calls 911 To Confess That He Killed His Girlfriend University Professor Shannon Lamb, who called 911, told the police that he shot his girlfriend with a gun and the police's voice that the houses should come just a bit vibrantly. Lamb said the \"love dog\" was alive and probably sad, and the family's phones could be found on the woman's mobile phone. The police found Amy Prentiss's immortal body at home and a handwritten note on a white notebook: \"I'm very sorry, I wish I could get everything back, I loved Amy so much and she was the only woman to love me so far.\" There was no evidence that Lamb, who gave two online lessons to the Delta State University in Mississippi, Cleveland, had already gone 300 miles to the school campus where the police’s beloved history professor Ethan Scmidt believed to have been shot and killed by Lamb in front of his office.\n",
            "Ref: In 911 Call, Professor Admits to Shooting Girlfriend In a 911 call, his voice only slightly shaky, college professor Shannon Lamb told police he had shot his girlfriend and officers needed to get over to their house. Lamb made a point to say his \"sweet dog\" was there alive and probably upset, and said the dead woman's family contacts could be found on her phone. Inside the home, officers found Amy Prentiss' body and a hand-written note scribbled on a white legal pad: \"I am so very sorry I wish I could take it back I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me,\" read the letter authorities say was signed by Lamb. There was no indication that Lamb, who was teaching two online classes for Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had already traveled 300 miles to the school's campus, where police believe he shot and killed a well-liked history professor, Ethan Schmidt, in the doorway to his office.\n",

Lamb noted that his \"love dog\" was alive and probably sad and that the family's phones of the deceased woman could be found on the woman's mobile phone. Police found a handwritten note of Amy Prentiss's unhealthy body and a white notebook at home: \"I am very sorry, I wish I could return everything, I loved Amy very much and she was the only woman to love me so far.\" Lamb noted that his \"love dog\" was alive and possibly sad and that the family's phones of the deceased woman could be found on the woman's mobile phone. He said he heard Lamb's devastating 911 call and said he did it shortly after that, and another death occurred at the end of the day: Lamb committed suicide when the police approached him.

Lamb made a point to say his \"sweet dog\" was there alive and probably upset, and said the dead woman's family contacts could be found on her phone. Inside the home, officers found Amy Prentiss' body and a hand-written note scribbled on a white legal pad: \"I am so very sorry I wish I could take it back I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me,\" read the letter authorities say was signed by Lamb. There was no indication that Lamb, who was teaching two online classes for Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had already traveled 300 miles to the school's campus, where police believe he shot and killed a well-liked history professor, Ethan Schmidt, in the doorway to his office. Delta State University police chief Lynn Buford said university officials heard about the shooting at 10:18 a.m. He said Lamb made the fateful 911 call sometime after that. By the end of the day, there would be one more death: Lamb took his own life as police closed in on him. A day after the school shooting forced students and faculty to hide behind locked doors, authorities were still trying to piece together what motivated Lamb.

Electricity is an important industrial medium, and Afghanistan is growing and growing in a large and small size in a separate region. But it’s better that some speeches in the use of the new word are taken into account that the chance of removal is reduced: It’s not a good thing that the people will get away from their majority groups and other cities.\n",

Keeping an orchard requires a lot of effort and requires a lot of work for a good fruit yield. silk baskets manufacturing is an important industrial medium,and were manufacturing and still manufacturing in small and large scales in different parts of Afghanistan. It will be great to focus on using new vocabularies to avoid any chances of errors. It should be noted that Bhais keep their internal issues secret from general public.\n",

Șeful ONU a solicitat din nou tuturor părților, inclusiv Consiliului de securitate ONU divizat să se unifice și să susțină negocierile pentru a găsi o soluție politică.

            "Src: Șeful ONU declară că nu există soluții militare în Siria Secretarul General Ban Ki-moon afirmă că răspunsul său la suportul militar al Rusiei pentru Siria este că „nu există o soluție militară” la conflictul care durează de aproape cinci ani iar mai multe arme nu ar face decât să agraveze violența și suferința a milioane de oameni. Șeful ONU a solicitat din nou tuturor părților, inclusiv Consiliului de securitate ONU divizat să se unifice și să susțină negocierile pentru a găsi o soluție politică. Ban a declarat miercuri în cadrul unei conferințe că intenționează să se întâlnească luna aceasta cu miniștrii de externe din cinci țări permanent prezente în consiliu - SUA, Rusia, China, Anglia și Franța - pe marginea sesiunii ministeriale a Adunării Generale pentru a discuta despre Siria. Ban și-a exprimat regretul că divizările în consiliu și între poporul sirian și puterile regionale „au făcut această situație de nerezolvat”. Ban le-a cerut celor cinci membri permanenți să dea dovadă de solidaritatea și unitatea arătate atunci când au reușit să încheie un acord referitor la armele nucleare ale Iranului, abordând astfel criza din Siria. 8 cifre din sondaje care arată că Donald Trump are șanse reale Unii au încercat să îl eticheteze ca politician „flip-flop”. Alții l-au numit o glumă. Iar alții așteaptă implozia.\n",

The UN head again urged all parties, including the divided UN Security Council, to unite and support negotiations to find a political solution. Ban said on Wednesday at a conference that he intends to meet this month with foreign ministers from five permanently present countries in the Council – the U.S., Russia, China, England and France – on the edge of the General Assembly’s ministerial session to discuss Syria. Ban expressed regret that divisions in the Council and between the Syrian people and the regional powers “made this situation unresolved.” Ban called on the five permanent members to prove their solidarity and unity when they managed to conclude an agreement on Iran’s nuclear weapons, thus addressing the Syrian crisis. Eight figures from the surveys that show that Donald Trump has real chances of the Union have tried to label him as a “flip-flop” politician. Some called it a joke. And others are waiting for the implosion.\n",

It is not just a formal gathering,” L. Belevičius noted. The new advocate A. Doroševas admitted that he had not yet had time to get familiar either with the statement of charges or the case file in full. In the previous hearing the suspect Š.

Tuomet \"MG Baltic\" advokatas Linas Belevičius pareiškė, kad siekiant užtikrinti visavertę asmens gynybą teisėjų kolegija turi leisti naujajam advokatui susipažinti su bylos medžiaga ir prašė nukelti teismo posėdį. \"Kad užtikrintų asmens gynybą, jis turi susipažinti su baudžiamosios bylos medžiaga. Tai nėra tik formalus pasėdėjimas\", - teigė L. Belevičius. Naujasis advokatas A. Doroševas pažymėjo nespėjęs susipažinti nei su kaltinamuoju aktu, nei su visa bylos medžiaga. Prieš tai buvusiame teismo posėdyje įtariamasis Š. Gustainis pranešė atsisakąs savo advokato, nes jis nebegalįs jam sumokėti. Posėdyje taip pat buvo klausomi garso įrašai.\n",

The hearing started with testifying by the defendants. In the previous hearing, Aleksandras Doroševas, the new state-appointed advocate of Š. Gustainis, said to the panel of judges that he had not read the case file in full yet. Then, Linas Belevičius, advocate of MG Baltic, declared that in order to ensure appropriate defense for a person, the panel of judges must allow the new advocate to get familiar with the case file and asked to postpone the hearing. “In order to ensure person’s defense, he must get familiar with the material in the criminal case file. It is not just a formal gathering,” L. Belevičius noted. The new advocate A. Doroševas admitted that he had not yet had time to get familiar either with the statement of charges or the case file in full. In the previous hearing the suspect Š.

            "Src: Az élelmiszeren csúszott el az európai infláció Az eurózónában mért gyorsuló infláció fõleg az élelmiszerárak tempós növekedésének köszönhetõ. A novemberi áremelkedés az eurózóna 13 országában a vártnál nagyobb mértékû volt, az októberi 2,6 százalék után 3,1 százalékos éves inflációt regisztráltak - jelentette az unió luxemburgi statisztikai hivatala. A hivatalos elõrejelzés csak 3 százalékot valószínûsített - közölte a Bloomberg. Az Európai Központi Bank (ECB) amerikai, a brit és a kanadai jegybanktól eltérõen nem vágott az alapkamaton, mondván, hogy a csökkentés az emelkedõ nyersanyagárakkal és az enyhülõ munkanélküliséggel együtt inflációs spirál kialakulásához vezetne.\n",
            "Pred: European food inflation The accelerated inflation in the eurozone is mainly due to the rapid increase in food prices. In November, the price rise was higher than expected in 13 Eurozone countries, with an annual inflation of 3.1 per cent after 2.6 per cent in October, the EU statistics office in Luxembourg. The official predictions were only 3 percent likely, Bloomberg said. Unlike the U.S., British and Canadian central banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) did not cut the base interest rate, saying that the decrease would lead to an inflation spiral along with rising raw materials prices and reduced unemployment.\n",
            "Ref: Food: Where European inflation slipped up The skyward zoom in food prices is the dominant force behind the speed up in eurozone inflation. November price hikes were higher than expected in the 13 eurozone countries, with October's 2.6 percent yr/yr inflation rate followed by 3.1 percent in November, the EU's Luxembourg-based statistical office reported. Official forecasts predicted just 3 percent, Bloomberg said. As opposed to the US, UK, and Canadian central banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) did not cut interest rates, arguing that a rate drop combined with rising raw material prices and declining unemployment would trigger an inflationary spiral.\n",

A novemberi áremelkedés az eurózóna 13 országában a vártnál nagyobb mértékû volt, az októberi 2,6 százalék után 3,1 százalékos éves inflációt regisztráltak - jelentette az unió luxemburgi statisztikai hivatala. A hivatalos elõrejelzés csak 3 százalékot valószínûsített - közölte a Bloomberg. Az Európai Központi Bank (ECB) amerikai, a brit és a kanadai jegybanktól eltérõen nem vágott az alapkamaton, mondván, hogy a csökkentés az emelkedõ nyersanyagárakkal és az enyhülõ munkanélküliséggel együtt inflációs spirál kialakulásához vezetne. Az ECB két százalék alatt, de ahhoz közel szeretné tartani az inflációs rátá. Egy elemzõ szerint az ECB a huszonkettes csapdájában van: \"le kell beszélni\" az inflációt, hogy késõbb ne kelljen cselekednie ebben a témában. Németországban a novemberi infláció 3,3 százalékos értéke tizenkétéves rekordnak számít; Spanyolországban pedig 4,1-re emelkedett 3,6-rõl. Az eurózónás inflációt a megugró élelmiszer- és energiaárak röpítették magasra. A határidõs búzajegyzések 88 százalékkal emelkedtek, és a szójabab árfolyama is a legmagasabb értéket érte el 1973 óta.\n",

Sanfrancisko policija paziņoja, ka viņa nāve atzīta par slepkavību un šobrīd notiek izmeklēšana. Upura brālis Luiss Galicia stāsta Sanfrancisko raidstacijai ABC KGO, ka Frenks iepriekš strādājis par pavāru Bostonā, bet pirms sešiem mēnešiem viņš ticis pie sava sapņu darba restorānā \"Sons & Daughters\" Sanfrancisko. Restorāna \"Sons & Daughters\" pārstāvis informē, ka ziņa par viņa nāvi viņus šokēja un satrieca. \"Mēs esam maza komanda, kas strādā kā saliedēta ģimene un mums viņš ļoti pietrūks\", teica pārstāvis. Šajā grūtajā laikā mēs domās esam kopā ar Frenka draugiem un ģimeni. Luiss Galicia stāsta, ka sākumā Frenks esot nakšņojis hosteļos, bet pēdējā laikā dzīve beidzot esot uzlabojusies.\n",
